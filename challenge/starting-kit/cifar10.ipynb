    "\n",
    "The archive was extracted under the `cifar10` folder containing 3 sub-folders, one for each of the scenarios in the challenge:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `cifar10_lo`  : Models trained with DP-SGD and a small privacy budget ($\\epsilon \\approx 4$) \n",
    "- `cifar10_hi`  : Models trained with DP-SGD and a large privacy budget ($\\epsilon \\approx 10$) \n",
    "- `cifar10_inf` : Models trained without differential privacy guarantee ($\\epsilon = \\infty$)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these folders contains 3 other folders:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `train`: Models with metadata allowing to reconstruct their full training datasets. Use these to develop your attacks without having to train your own models.\n",
    "- `dev`: Models with metadata allowing to reconstruct just the set of challenge examples. Membership predictions for these challenges will be used to evaluate submissions during the competition and update the live scoreboard in CodaLab. \n",
    "- `final`: Models with metadata allowing to reconstruct just the set of challenge examples. Membership predictions for these challenges will be used to evaluate submissions when the competition closes and to determine the final ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each model folder in `train`, `dev`, and `final` contains a `model.pt` file with the model weights (a serialized PyTorch `state_dict`). There are 100 models in `train`, and 50 models in each of `dev` and `final`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Models in the `train` folder come with 3 PRNG seeds used to reconstruct the set of member and non-member challenge examples, and the rest of the examples in the training dataset of the model. Additionally (and redundantly), a `solution.csv` file reveals the membership information of the challenge examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Models in the `dev` and `final` folders contain just 1 PRNG seed used to reconstruct the set of challenge examples, without revealing which were included in the training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide utilities to reconstruct the different data splits from provided seeds and to load models as classes inheriting from `torch.nn.Module`. If you use TensorFlow, JAX, or any other framework, you can easily convert the models to the appropriate format (e.g. using ONXX).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Your task as a competitor is to produce, for each model in `dev` and `final`, a CSV file listing your confidence scores (values between 0 and 1) for the membership of the challenge examples. You must save these scores in a `prediction.csv` file and place it in the same folder as the corresponding model. A submission to the challenge is an an archive containing just these `prediction.csv` files.\n",
